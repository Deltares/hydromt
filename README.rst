**hydroMT** is a python package, developed by Deltares, to build and analysis hydro models.
It provides a generic model api with attributes to access the model schematization,
(dynamic) forcing data, results and states. hydroMT builds on the latest packages in the
scientific and geospatial python eco-system: It adopts the xarray_ data structure for 
model maps, rasterio_ for raster I/O, geopandas_ data structure for model geometries and 
vector I/O and the pyflwdir_ data structure flow direction data.
