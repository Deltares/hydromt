v0.7.0 (22 February 2023)
=========================

This release contains several major updates of the code. These following updates might require small changes to your code:

- Most noticeable is the change in the ``hydromt build`` CLI, where made the region argument optional and deprecated the resolution option. Futhermore, the user has to force existing folders to be overwritten when building new models.
- We also did a major overhaul of the ``GeoDataset`` and the associated ``.vector`` assessor to support any type of vector geometries (before only points).

More new features, including support for rotated grids, new cloud data catalogs and (caching of) tiled raster datasets and more details are listed below.


Changed
-------
- Removed resolution ('-r', '--res') from the hydromt build cli, made region (now '-r') an optional argument. PR #278
- If the model root already contains files when setting root, this will cause an error unless force overwrite (mode='w+' or --fo/--force-overwrite from command line). PR #278
- Revamped the GeoDataset (vector.py) to now work with geometry objects and wkt strings besides xy coordinates. PR #276
- GeoDataset can write to .nc that is compliant with ogr. PR #208

- strict and consistent read/write mode policy PR #238
- do not automatically read hydromt_data.yml file in model root. PR #238

  be applied similar to netcdf driver. PR #249

Added
-----

We also added new general subclasses to Model: ``GridModel``, ``LumpedModel``, ``MeshModel``, ``NetworkModel``.
These new subclasses have their own objects (e.g. grid for GridModel representing regular grids which replaces the old staticmaps object).

- In DataCatalog.get_RasterDataset & DataCatalog.get_GeoDataset methods, automatic renaming of single variable datasets based on the variables argument will be deprecated
- Interpolate missing values based on D4 neighbors of missing value cells only. This largely improves the performance without loosing accuracy.
  Changes have been observed when `nearest` method is used but this should not impact quality of the interpolation.

  multi-file rasterdatasets are only supported through the data catalog yml file

Fixed
-----
- fix incorrect nodata values at valid cells from scipy.griddata method in raster.interpolate_na

  a the global write method is skipped.
- default GTiff lwz compression with DataCatalog.export_data method
