Developer's environment
-----------------------

Developing HydroMT requires Python >= 3.6. We prefer developing with the most recent 
version of Python. We strongly encourage you to develop in a separate conda environment.
All Python dependencies required to develop HydroMT can be found in 
`envs/hydromt-dev.yml <https://github.com/Deltares/hydromt/blob/main/envs/hydromt-dev.yml>`_.

.. _dev_install:

Developer installation guide
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, clone the HydroMT ``git`` repo using `ssh <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account>`_ from
`github <https://github.com/Deltares/hydromt.git>`_.

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git@github.com:Deltares/hydromt.git
    $ cd hydromt

.. Note:: 
    
    In the commands below you can exchange `conda` for `mamba`, see :ref:`installation guide <installation_guide>` for the difference between both.

Then, navigate into the the code folder (where the envs folder and pyproject.toml are located):
Make and activate a new ``hydromt-dev`` conda environment based on the envs/hydromt-dev.yml
file contained in the repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda env create -f envs/hydromt-dev.yml
    $ conda activate hydromt-dev

Finally, create a developer installation of HydroMT:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install -e .
