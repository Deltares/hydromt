Examples: GIS functionalities (advanced)
========================================

At the core of HydroMT lies extensive GIS functionalities in order to process raw data to
meaningful information for a model. We include functions to process and work with raster
(regular grid) data, geodatasets (3D vector data such as point timeseries), elevation and
flow direction operations, or extreme value analysis. The following examples demonstrate
how to use these advanced GIS functionalities in HydroMT which can be useful for plugin
development or advanced data processing tasks in python tools or scripts.

Please see the :ref:`installation guide <installation_guide>` to see how to install HydroMT
and to :ref:`download the examples <installation_examples>`.
