HydroMT and plugins
-------------------
More often than not, we use HydroMT together with a :ref:`plugin <plugins>` to work with
specific model software. HydroMT core then provides the command line and Python interface,
data handling via the data catalog (and adapters) and generic GIS methods.

The plugin provides model-specific GIS methods and allows to read and write model data
in the model's native format.
