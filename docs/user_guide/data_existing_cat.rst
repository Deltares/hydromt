Pre-defined data catalogs
=========================

This page contains a list of (global) datasets which can be used with various HydroMT models and workflows.
Below are drop down lists with datasets per pre-defined data catalog for use with HydroMT.
The summary per dataset contains links to the online source and available literature.

The ``deltares_data`` catalog is only available within the Deltares network. However a selection of this data for a the
Piave basin (Northern Italy) is available online in the ``artifact_data`` archive and will be used if no data catalog is provided.
Local or other datasets can also be included by extending the data catalog with new yaml :ref:`data catalog files <data_yaml>`.
We plan to provide more data catalogs with open data sources in the (near) future. See the data catalog `changelog <https://github.com/Deltares/hydromt/blob/main/data/catalogs/changelog.rst>`_ for recent updates on the pre-defined catalogs.
