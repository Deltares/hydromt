.. _data_types:

Supported data types
====================

HydroMT currently supports the following data types:

- :ref:`RasterDataset <RasterDataset>`: static and dynamic raster (or gridded) data
- :ref:`GeoDataFrame <GeoDataFrame>`: static vector data
- :ref:`GeoDataset <GeoDataset>`: dynamic point location data
- :ref:`Dataset <Dataset>`:  non-spatial n-dimensional data
- :ref:`DataFrame <DataFrame>`: 2D tabular data

Internally the RasterDataset, GeoDataset, and Dataset are represented by :py:class:`xarray.Dataset` objects,
the GeoDataFrame by :py:class:`geopandas.GeoDataFrame`, and the DataFrame by
:py:class:`pandas.DataFrame`. We use drivers, typically from third-party packages and sometimes
wrapped in HydroMT functions, to parse many different file formats to this standardized internal
data representation.

.. note::

    Please contact us through the issue list if you would like to add other drivers.

.. _dimensions:

Recognized dimension names
--------------------------

- **time**: time or date stamp ["time"].
- **x**: x coordinate ["x", "longitude", "lon", "long"].
- **y**: y-coordinate ["y", "latitude", "lat"].

.. _RasterDataset:

---------------------------

- :ref:`Single variable GeoTiff raster <GeoTiff>`
- :ref:`Multi variable Virtual Raster Tileset (VRT) <VRT>`

.. _GeoTiff:

**Single variable GeoTiff raster**

Single raster files are parsed to a **RasterDataset** based on the **raster** driver.
This driver supports 2D raster for which the dimensions are names "x" and "y".
A potential third dimension is called "dim0".
The variable name is based on the filename, in this case "GLOBCOVER_200901_200912_300x300m".
The ``chunks`` key-word argument is passed to :py:meth:`~hydromt.io.open_mfraster`
and allows lazy reading of the data.

.. _VRT:

Multi-variable Virtual Raster Tileset (VRT)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Multiple raster layers from different files are parsed using the **raster** driver.
Each raster becomes a variable in the resulting RasterDataset based on its filename.
The path to multiple files can be set using a sting glob or several keys,
see description of the ``path`` argument in the :ref:`yaml file description <data_yaml>`.
Note that the rasters should have identical grids.

Here multiple .vrt files (dir.vrt, bas.vrt, etc.) are combined based on their variable name
into a single dataset with variables flwdir, basins, etc.
Other multiple file raster datasets (e.g. GeoTIFF files) can be read in the same way.
VRT files are useful for large raster datasets which are often tiled and can be combined using
`gdalbuildvrt. <https://gdal.org/programs/gdalbuildvrt.html>`_

.. _Tile:

Tiled raster dataset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tiled index datasets are parsed using the **raster_tindex** driver.
This data format is used to combine raster tiles with different CRS projections.
A polygon vector file (e.g. GeoPackage) is used to make a tile index with the spatial
footprints of each tile. When reading a spatial slice of this data the files with
intersecting footprints will be merged together in the CRS of the most central tile.
Use `gdaltindex <https://gdal.org/programs/gdaltindex.html>`_ to build an excepted tile index file.

Here a GeoPackage with the tile index referring to individual GeoTiff raster tiles is used.
The ``mosaic_kwargs`` are passed to :py:meth:`~hydromt.io.open_raster_from_tindex` to
set the resampling ``method``. The name of the column in the tile index attribute table ``tileindex``
which contains the raster tile file names is set in the ``driver_kwargs`` (to be directly passed as an argument to
:py:meth:`~hydromt.io.open_raster_from_tindex`).

.. code-block:: yaml

.. NOTE::

  Tiled raster datasets are not read lazily as different tiles have to be merged together based on
  their values. For fast access to large raster datasets, other formats might be more suitable.

.. _NC_raster:

Netcdf raster dataset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Netcdf and Zarr raster data are typically used for dynamic raster data and
parsed using the **netcdf** and **zarr** drivers.
A typical raster netcdf or zarr raster dataset has the following structure with
two ("y" and "x") or three ("time", "y" and "x") dimensions.
See list of recognized dimensions_ names.

.. code-block:: console

    Dimensions:      (latitude: NY, longitude: NX, time: NT)
    Coordinates:
      * longitude    (longitude)
      * latitude     (latitude)
      * time         (time)
    Data variables:
        temp         (time, latitude, longitude)
        precip       (time, latitude, longitude)


To read a raster dataset from a multiple file netcdf archive the following data entry
is used, where the ``driver_kwargs`` are passed to :py:func:`xarray.open_mfdataset`
(or :py:func:`xarray.open_zarr` for zarr data).
In case the CRS cannot be inferred from the netcdf data it should be defined with the ``crs`` option here.
The path to multiple files can be set using a sting glob or several keys,
see description of the ``path`` argument in the :ref:`yaml file description <data_yaml>`.
In this example additional renaming and unit conversion preprocessing steps are added to
unify the data to match the HydroMT naming and unit :ref:`terminology <terminology>`.

.. code-block:: yaml

    era5_hourly:
      path: forcing/ERA5/org/era5_{variable}_{year}_hourly.nc

Preprocess functions when combining multiple files
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In :py:func:`xarray.open_mfdataset`, xarray allows for a *preprocess* function to be run before merging several
netcdf files together. In hydroMT, some preprocess functions are available and can be passed through the ``driver_kwargs``
options in the same way as any xr.open_mfdataset options. These preprocess functions are:

- **round_latlon**: round x and y dimensions to 5 decimals to avoid merging problems in xarray due to small differences
  in x, y values in the different netcdf files of the same data source.
- **to_datetimeindex**: force parsing the time dimension to a datetime index.
- **remove_duplicates**: remove time duplicates



.. _GeoDataFrame:

Vector data (GeoDataFrame)
--------------------------

- :ref:`GeoPackage spatial vector data <GPKG_vector>`
- :ref:`Point vector from text delimited data <textdelimited_vector>`

.. _vector_formats:

   :header-rows: 1

   * - Driver
     - File formats

     - Point, Line and Polygon geometries. Uses :py:func:`geopandas.read_file`
   * - ``vector_table``
     - CSV, XY, PARQUET and EXCEL.
     - :py:meth:`~hydromt.io.open_vector`
     - Point geometries only. Uses :py:meth:`~hydromt.io.open_vector_from_table`



.. _GPKG_vector:

GeoPackage spatial vector data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Spatial vector data is parsed to a **GeoDataFrame** using the **vector** driver.
For large spatial vector datasets we recommend the GeoPackage format as it includes a
spatial index for fast filtering of the data based on spatial location. An example is
shown below. Note that the rename, ``unit_mult``, ``unit_add`` and ``nodata`` options refer to
columns of the attribute table in case of a GeoDataFrame.

.. code-block:: yaml

      GDP_world:
        path: base/emissions/GDP-countries/World_countries_GDPpcPPP.gpkg
        data_type: GeoDataFrame
        driver: vector
        driver_kwargs:
          layer: GDP
        rename:
          GDP: gdp
        unit_mult:
          gdp: 0.001
        meta:
          category: socio-economic
          source_version: 1.0

.. _textdelimited_vector:

Point vector from text delimited data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tabulated point vector data files can be parsed to a **GeoDataFrame** with the **vector_table**
driver. This driver reads CSV (or similar delimited text files), EXCEL and XY
(white-space delimited text file without headers) files. See this list of :ref:`dimension names <dimensions>`
for recognized x and y column names.

A typical CSV point vector file is given below. A similar setup with headers
can be used to read other text delimited files or excel files.

.. code-block:: console

    index, x, y, col1, col2
    <ID1>, <X1>, <Y1>, <>, <>
    <ID2>, <X2>, <Y2>, <>, <>
    ...

A XY files looks like the example below. As it does not contain headers or an index, the first column
is assumed to contain the x-coordinates, the second column the y-coordinates and the
index is a simple enumeration starting at 1. Any additional column is saved as column
of the GeoDataFrame attribute table.

.. code-block:: console

    <X1>, <Y1>, <>, <>
    <X2>, <Y2>, <>, <>
    ...

As the CRS of the coordinates cannot be inferred from the data it must be set in the
data entry in the yaml file as shown in the example below. The internal data format
is based on the file extension unless the ``driver_kwargs`` ``driver`` option is set.
See :py:meth:`~hydromt.io.open_vector` and :py:func:`~hydromt.io.open_vector_from_table` for more
options.

.. code-block:: yaml

    stations:
      path: /path/to/stations.csv
      data_type: GeoDataFrame
      driver: vector_table
      crs: 4326
      driver_kwargs:
        driver: csv

.. _binary_vector:

HydroMT also supports reading and writing vector data in binary format. Currently only parquet is
supported, but others could be added if desired. The structure of the files should be the same as
the text format files described above but writing according to the parquet file spec. Since this is
a binary format, not examples are provided, but for example pandas can write the same data structure
to parquet as it can csv.


.. _GeoDataset:

Geospatial point time-series (GeoDataset)
-----------------------------------------

- :ref:`Netcdf point time-series dataset <NC_point>`
- :ref:`CSV point time-series data <CSV_point>`

.. _geo_formats:

   * - ``netcdf`` or ``zarr``
     - NetCDF and Zarr
     - :py:func:`xarray.open_mfdataset`, :py:func:`xarray.open_zarr`
     - required time and index dimensions_ and x- and y coordinates.


.. _NC_point:

Netcdf point time-series dataset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Netcdf and Zarr point time-series data are parsed to **GeoDataset** using the **netcdf** and **zarr** drivers.
A typical netcdf or zarr point time-series dataset has the following structure with
two ("time" and "index") dimensions, where the index dimension has x and y coordinates.
The time dimension and spatial coordinates are inferred from the data based
on a list of recognized dimensions_ names.

.. code-block:: console

    Dimensions:      (stations: N, time: NT)
    Coordinates:
      * time         (time)
      * stations     (stations)
        lon          (stations)
        lat          (stations)
    Data variables:
        waterlevel   (time, stations)

To read a point time-series dataset from a multiple file netcdf archive the following data entry
is used, where the ``driver_kwargs`` are passed to :py:func:`xarray.open_mfdataset`
(or :py:func:`xarray.open_zarr` for zarr data).
In case the CRS cannot be inferred from the netcdf data it is defined here.
The path to multiple files can be set using a sting glob or several keys,
see description of the ``path`` argument in the :ref:`yaml file description <data_yaml>`.
In this example additional renaming and unit conversion preprocessing steps are added to
unify the data to match the HydroMT naming and unit :ref:`terminology <terminology>`.

.. _CSV_point:

CSV point time-series data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Point time-series data where the geospatial point geometries and time-series are saved in
separate (text) files are parsed to **GeoDataset** using the **vector** driver.
The GeoDataset must at least contain a location index with point geometries which is referred to by the ``path`` argument
The path may refer to both GIS vector data such as GeoJSON with only Point geometries
or tabulated point vector data such as csv files, see earlier examples for GeoDataFrame datasets.
Finally, certain binary formats such as parquet are also supported.
In addition a tabulated time-series text file can be passed to be used as a variable of the GeoDataset.
This data is added by a second file which is referred to using the ``fn_data`` key-word argument.
The index of the time-series (in the columns header) and point locations must match.
For more options see the :py:meth:`~hydromt.io.open_geodataset` method.

.. code-block:: yaml

    waterlevels_txt:
      path: /path/to/stations.csv

      crs: 4326
      driver_kwargs:
        fn_data: /path/to/stations_data.csv

*Tabulated time series text file*

This data is read using the :py:meth:`~hydromt.io.open_timeseries_from_table` method. To
read the time stamps the :py:func:`pandas.to_datetime` method is used.

.. _NC_timeseries:


Netcdf time-series dataset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NetCDF and zarr timeseries data are parsed to **Dataset** with the **netcdf** and **zarr** drivers.
The resulting dataset is similar to the **GeoDataset** except that it lacks a spatial dimension.

.. note::

    Only 2-dimensional data tables are supported, please contact us through the issue list if you would like to have support for n-dimensional tables.


Supported files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The DataFrameAdapter is quite flexible in supporting different types of tabular data formats. All drivers allow for flexible reading of
files: for example both mapping tables and time series data are supported. Please note that for timeseries, the driver_kwargs need to be used to
set the correct column for indexing, and formatting and parsing of datetime-strings. See the relevant pandas function for which arguments
can be used. Also note that the **csv** driver is not restricted to comma-separated files, as the delimiter can be given to the reader
through the driver_kwargs.

.. code-block:: yaml

    observations:
      path: data/lulc/globcover_mapping.csv
      data_type: DataFrame
      driver: csv
      meta:
        category: parameter_mapping
      driver_kwargs:
        header: null  # null translates to None in Python -> no header
        index_col: 0
        parse_dates: false

.. note::
    The yml-parser does not correctly parses `None` arguments. When this is required, the `null` argument should be used instead.
    This is parsed to the Python code as a `None`.
