Defining a model region
-----------------------

To setup a model for a specific region, you can use several geospatial or hydrographic region definitions which are explained in this chapter.
The syntax is interpreted using the :py:meth:`~hydromt.workflows.basin_mask.parse_region` method.
For hydrographic regions see also the `delineate basins <../_examples/delineate_basin.ipynb>`_ example and :py:meth:`~hydromt.workflows.basin_mask.get_basin_geometry` method.

.. NOTE::

    All x and y coordinates in the *point* and *bbox* are in the EPSG:4326 (WGS84) coordinate reference system.

Geospatial region
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Bounding box (bbox): ``{'bbox': [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax]}``

    Geometry file (geom): ``{'geom': '/path/to/geometry_file'}``

    Based on another model: ``{'<model_name>': '/path/to/model_root'}``

    Based on a raster file: ``{'grid': '/path/to/raster_file'}``

    Based on a mesh file: ``{'mesh': '/path/to/mesh_file'}``

Hydrographic region
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following hydrographic regions are supported:

- basin
- subbasin
- interbasin


**Basin**: is defined by the entire area which drains to the sea or an inland depression.
To delineate the basin(s) touching a region or point location, users can supply the following:

    - One point location: ``{'basin': [x, y]}``

    - More point locations: ``{'basin': [[x1, x2, ..], [y1, y2, ..]]}``

    - Bounding box: ``{'basin': [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax]}``

    - Geometry file: ``{'basin': '/path/to/geometry_file'}``

    - Single unique basin ID: ``{'basin': [ID1]}``

    - Several unique basin ID: ``{'basin': [ID1, ID2, ..]}``

    To filter basins, variable-threshold pairs to define streams can be used in combination with
    a bounding box or geometry file, e.g.: ``'uparea':30`` to filter based on streams with
    a minimum drainage area of 30 km2 or ``'strord':8`` to filter basins based on streams
    with a minimal stream order of 8. The variables should be available in the dataset on which
    the delineation is based, e.g. Hydro MERIT.

    - ``{'basin': [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax], '<variable>': threshold}``

    To only select basins with their outlet location use ``'outlets': true`` in combination with
    a bounding box or geometry file

    - ``{'basin': [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax], 'outlets': true}``


**Subbasin**: is defined by the area that drains into an outlet, stream or region.
Users can supply the following:

    - One point location: ``{'subbasin': [x, y]}``

    - More point locations: ``{'subbasin': [[x1, x2, ..], [y1, y2, ..]]}``

    - Bounding box: ``{'subbasin': [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax]}``

    - Geometry file: ``{'subbasin': '/path/to/geometry_file'}``

    To speed up the delineation process users can supply an estimated initial
    bounding box in combination with all the options mentioned above.
    A warning will be raised if the bounding box does not contain all upstream area.

    - ``{'subbasin': [x, y], 'bounds': [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax]}``

    The subbasins can further be refined based on one (or more) variable-threshold pair(s)
    to define streams, as described above for basins. If used in combination with point outlet locations,
    these are snapped to the nearest stream which meets the threshold criteria.

    - ``{'subbasin': [x, y], '<variable>': threshold}``


**Interbasin**: is defined by the area that drains into an outlet or stream and
bounded by a region and therefore does not necessarily including all upstream area.
Users should supply a bounding region in combination with stream and/or outlet arguments.
The bounding region is defined by a bounding box or a geometry file; streams by a
(or more) variable-threshold pair(s) and outlet by point location coordinates.
Similar to subbasins, point locations are snapped to nearest downstream stream if
combined with stream arguments.

    - ``{'interbasin': [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax], '<variable>': threshold}``

    - ``{'interbasin': /path/to/geometry_file, '<variable>': threshold}``

    - ``{'interbasin': [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax], '<variable>': threshold, 'xy': [x, y]}``

    To only select interbasins based on the outlet location of the entire basins use ``'outlets': true``

    ``{'interbasin': [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax], 'outlets': true}``
