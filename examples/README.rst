Several iPython notebook examples have been prepared for **HydroMT** which you can
use as a HydroMT tutorial.

These examples can be run online or on your local machine.
To run these examples online press the **binder** badge above.

Local installation
------------------

To run these examples on your local machine you need a copy of the repository and
an installation of HydroMT including some additional packages. The most reliable
way to do this installation is by using the binder imlementation provided above, however
if you wish to exectute them locally you should create a new environment as described below.

1 - Install python and conda/mamba
**********************************
If not already done, you'll need Python 3.9 or greater and a package manager such as conda or mamba. These package managers help you to install (Python) packages and
`manage environments <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>`_ such that different installations do not conflict.

We recommend using the `Mambaforge <https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge>`_ Python distribution. This installs Python and the
`mamba package manager <https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba>`_. Alternatively, `Miniforge <https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge>`_ and
`Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_ will install Python and the `conda package manager <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`_.

If you already have a python & conda installation but do not yet have mamba installed, we recommend installing it into your *base* environment using:

.. code-block:: console

  $ conda install mamba -n base -c conda-forge

2 - Download the content of the HydroMT github repository
*********************************************************
To run the examples locally, you will need to download the content of the HydroMT repository. You can either do a
`manual download <https://github.com/Deltares/hydromt/archive/refs/heads/main.zip>`_ and extract the content of the downloaded ZIP folder
**or** clone the repository locally:

.. code-block:: console

  $ git clone https://github.com/Deltares/hydromt.git

3 - Install HydroMT and the other python dependencies in a separate Python environment
**************************************************************************************
The next step is to install all the python dependencies required to run the notebooks, including HydroMT.

For a more detailed explanation please refer to `the dev instalation guide <https://deltares.github.io/hydromt/latest/dev/dev_install.html>`_

It should be noted however, that due to our release cycle the examples in the repository might not be
compatible with the version of hydromt you have installed, particulary if you followed the guide on
`Getting Started <https://deltares.github.io/hydromt/latest/getting_started/installation.html>`_ which
or installed hydromt through either pip or conda forge. The examples in the repositroy are compatible
with the latest `dev` version of hydromt. If you follow the dev instalation guide linked above, everything
should work as intended. However if you already have a version of hydromt installed, you will have to checkout that release in the repository.

For example let's say you want to try out the examples and you already have version 0.7.1 installed.
Then you can retrieve the correct examples by executing the following command from within the
hydromt folder you created in the last step:

.. code-block:: console

  $ git checkout v0.7.1

this will give you the example files in the state they were at the time of that release.


4 - Running the examples
************************
Finally, start a jupyter notebook inside the ``examples`` folder after activating the ``hydromt`` environment, see below.
Alternatively, you can run the notebooks from `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/download>`_ if you have that installed.

.. code-block:: console

  $ conda activate hydromt
  $ cd hydromt/examples
  $ jupyter notebook
