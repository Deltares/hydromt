    "In this example we illustrate some common hydrology GIS problems based on so-called [flow direction data](https://deltares.github.io/pyflwdir/latest/flwdir.html). In HydroMT we make use of functionality from [pyflwdir](https://deltares.github.io/pyflwdir/latest/) to work with this type of data. HydroMT wraps some functionality of **pyflwdir**, to make it easier to work with [raster datasets](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt/latest/user_guide/data_types.html). However, pyflwdir has much more functionality. An overview of all the flow direction methods in HydroMT can be found in the [Reference API](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt/latest/api.html#flow-direction-methods)\n",

To do this we need to transform the gridded flow direction data into a `FlwdirRaster` object using the [flwdir_from_da()](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt/latest/_generated/hydromt.flw.flwdir_from_da.html) method.
