The\n included version has been heavily modified by Rich Felker in 2012, in\n the interests of size, simplicity, and namespace cleanliness.\n\n Much of the math library code (src/math/* and src/complex/*) is\n Copyright  1993,2004 Sun Microsystems or\n Copyright  2003-2011 David Schultz or\n Copyright  2003-2009 Steven G. Kargl or\n Copyright  2003-2009 Bruce D. Evans or\n Copyright  2008 Stephen L. Moshier or\n Copyright  2017-2018 Arm Limited\n and labelled as such in comments in the individual source files. All\n have been licensed under extremely permissive terms.\n\n The ARM memcpy code (src/string/arm/memcpy.S) is Copyright  2008\n The Android Open Source Project and is licensed under a two-clause BSD\n license. It was taken from Bionic libc, used on Android.\n\n The AArch64 memcpy and memset code (src/string/aarch64/*) are\n Copyright  1999-2019, Arm Limited.\n\n The implementation of DES for crypt (src/crypt/crypt_des.c) is\n Copyright  1994 David Burren. It is licensed under a BSD license.\n\n The implementation of blowfish crypt (src/crypt/crypt_blowfish.c) was\n originally written by Solar Designer and placed into the public\n domain. The code also comes with a fallback permissive license for use\n in jurisdictions that may not recognize the public domain.\n\n The smoothsort implementation (src/stdlib/qsort.c) is Copyright  2011\n Valentin Ochs and is licensed under an MIT-style license.\n\n The x86_64 port was written by Nicholas J. Kain and is licensed under\n the standard MIT terms.\n\n The mips and microblaze ports were originally written by Richard\n Pennington for use in the ellcc project. The original code was adapted\n by Rich Felker for build system and code conventions during upstream\n integration. It is licensed under the standard MIT terms.\n\n The mips64 port was contributed by Imagination Technologies and is\n licensed under the standard MIT terms.\n\n The powerpc port was also originally written by Richard Pennington,\n and later supplemented and integrated by John Spencer. It is licensed\n under the standard MIT terms.\n\n All other files which have no copyright comments are original works\n produced specifically for use as part of this library, written either\n by Rich Felker, the main author of the library, or by one or more\n contibutors listed above. Details on authorship of individual files\n can be found in the git version control history of the project. The\n omission of copyright and license comments in each file is in the\n interest of source tree size.\n\n In addition, permission is hereby granted for all public header files\n (include/* and arch/*/bits/*) and crt files intended to be linked into\n applications (crt/*, ldso/dlstart.c, and arch/*/crt_arch.h) to omit\n the copyright notice and permission notice otherwise required by the\n license, and to use these files without any requirement of\n attribution. These files include substantial contributions from:\n\n Bobby Bingham\n John Spencer\n Nicholas J. Kain\n Rich Felker\n Richard Pennington\n Stefan Kristiansson\n Szabolcs Nagy\n\n all of whom have explicitly granted such permission.\n\n This file previously contained text expressing a belief that most of\n the files covered by the above exception were sufficiently trivial not\n to be subject to copyright, resulting in confusion over whether it\n negated the permissions granted in the license. In the spirit of\n permissive licensing, and of not having licensing issues being an\n obstacle to adoption, that text has been removed.Copyright (c) 2005-2023, NumPy Developers.\n All rights reserved.\n\n Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\n modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are\n met:\n\n     * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n        notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n     * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above\n        copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n        disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided\n        with the distribution.\n\n     * Neither the name of the NumPy Developers nor the names of any\n        contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived\n        from this software without specific prior written permission.\n\n THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS\n \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\n LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\n A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n ==========================\n\n Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\n Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\n as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\n principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n\n In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\n National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\n in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\n software.\n\n In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\n BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\n year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became\n Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\n https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization\n created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.\n Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.\n\n All Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for\n the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\n releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\n the various releases.\n\n     Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\n                     from                                compatible? (1)\n\n     0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes\n     1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes\n     1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no\n     2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no\n     1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)\n     2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no\n     2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes\n     2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes\n     2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes\n     2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes\n     2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes\n\n Footnotes:\n\n (1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under\n     the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\n     a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\n     GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n     other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n\n (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n     because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n     CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n     is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n\n Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\n direction to make these releases possible.\n\n\n B. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR ACCESSING OR OTHERWISE USING PYTHON\n ===============================================================\n\n Python software and documentation are licensed under the\n Python Software Foundation License Version 2.\n\n Starting with Python 3.8.6, examples, recipes, and other code in\n the documentation are dual licensed under the PSF License Version 2\n and the Zero-Clause BSD license.\n\n Some software incorporated into Python is under different licenses.\n The licenses are listed with code falling under that license.\n\n\n PYTHON SOFTWARE FOUNDATION LICENSE VERSION 2\n --------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
