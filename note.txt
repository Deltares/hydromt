- [ ] what is the distinction between `model.region.read` and `region({'geom':path/to/file'}).construct()`?

region is like a model component
region.read should check read permissions etc. 

in build mode you build a region from dict in update you build it from model 

more setup_region to model.region.set and move functionality to model_region class.
